# Giphy
Make a gif page using api and pull from api key to make a giphy page.
My giphy page is all about different TV shows.
Click on one of the Tv shows for the gifs to pop up.
I have added an animate variable for the gifs to animate when clicked and off again if clicked again.
If you want to search for a TV program you enjoy just search in the search bar and it will add the show to the end of the list given to you.
Have fun and enjoy! Below is the link to my github pages for the giphy project!
